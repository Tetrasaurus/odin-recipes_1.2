      Skydiving is a growing sport the many view as an extreme choice but once
      you start to get used to your equipment and understand the risks and
      safety precautions required you soon start to get beyond the fear of
      "jumping out a plane" and look towards the numerous progression paths and
      disciplines to develop your skills respective to your interests.

    <h2><u>Unqualified Jumper?</u></h2>
    <p>
      The first step before following your respective dreams of flying/freefall
      is to become a qualifed skydiver. There are many freefall associations
      throughout the world with similar regulations that cover the most
      important aspects of your own safety, ranging from emergency procedures,
      equipment understanding/uses, aircraft rules, ground rules, freefall
      procedures and canopy flight basics. After a specified number of different
      completed skydivers you will be signed off to jump as a solo skydiver, you
      will be responsible for yourself and your own safety(with limited
      supervision) - You cannot begin to start any of the further
      disciplines until you are able to look after yourself as a qualified
      member of a respective association.
