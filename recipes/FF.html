    <h1>(FF) - Free-flying</h1>

    <p>
      This discipline is significantly different to the belly to earth
      orientation experience in your AFF/FS. When free flying you will be in a
      vertical orientation either Head up (HU) or Head down(HD). With the change
      in orientation there is a significant change is speed - where jumps would
      usually last [55secs] now only lasting MAX [45 sec] (10 secs is A LOT in
      the sky!)
    </p>

    <p>
        <h3><u>Requirements</u></h3>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>B-license, usually more the 50+ skydives and a number of other proficiencies</li>
                <li>(FS) rating, this shows that you have learnt to fly relative to others safely at slower speeds <em>ie) basics are well dialed in</em></li>
                <li>Free-fly 'friendly' rig, due to high speeds rigs that are not snug fit and tight around the container can cause massive issues, such as premature openings..</li>
                <li>Audibles , this is an audio alti meter that sounds off at specified hieghts - again due to <strong>HIGH SPEEDS</strong> further saftey precautions are in place</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <h4><u>How to get your (FF) rating</u></h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Find a (FF) coach</li>
                <li>Get brief from coach on vertical flying orientation,safety flying with others and complete proficiency jumps. (FF) can be done headup (HU) and headdown (HD) - (HD) is consisdered very advanced and extremely difficult to learn the balance, therefore we will only be talking about (HU) headup or 'sit-flying'.
                    <p><ul>
                        <li>Back-flying , you need to be able to recover from any orientation when freeflying, you will most likely fall onto your back therefore back-flying is <strong>fundamental</strong></li>
                        <li>nose/tail facing exits</li>
                        <li>(HU) Flying position - the balance and technical aspects of this discipline takes time and hence why many <strong>recommend  trying to FF after at least <u>100 skydives</u> MINIMUM</strong></li>
                        <li>Fast(stand)) & slow fall(a type of almost backflying)</li>
                        <li>Forward/stop and back/stop</li>
                        <li>Turns L/R</li>
                        <li>Break-off heights</li>
                        <LI>CORRECT break-off procedure - transition to back then roll to belly, checking air space</LI>
                        <li>Tracking away from group</li>
                    </p></ul>
                </li>
                <p>
                <li>Learning to hold HU orientation for the entire jump is a difficult challenge that eventually becomes natural even then the slights change of body position/balance can make a massive difference! Your coach will judge you ability and awareness - this is the hardest part of achieving the rating. Once you can exit stable - turn L/R - fast fall - slow fall - forward/back - clean breakoff - you may be ready but this can take time </li>
                <li>Your now ready to jump with others! <em>Its recommended to keep to 2 or 3 ways until you are comfortable flying with others and all the above becomes second nature!</em></li></p>
            </ol>
