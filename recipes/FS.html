    <h1>(FS) - Formation Skydiving</h1>

    <p>
      This will be the most important skill set to learn after becoming a
      qualifed skydiver. During the AFF course you learn how to fly your own
      body, safety protocols to look after yourself and the very basics of being
      a skydiver without too much information over load.
    </p>
    <p>
      (FS) - is falling to the ground in the neutral(belly) position learnt in
      the AFF course. However this position is improved so that moving around
      the air becomes more efficient and natural to fly
